	<h2>Pick Wisely When You Picnic as NEW Survey Exposes Dangerously High Salty Finger Foods That Could Put Your Health at Risk(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>One in four savoury picnic foods are dangerously HIGH in salt</li>
		<li>Some olives contain DOUBLE the salt concentration of seawater whilst other products have more salt than a McDonald’s hamburger and fries</li>
		<li>Half of products are higher in salt than their average salt targets</li>
		<li>Almost one in three products have no colour-coded front of pack (FoP) labelling making it hard for consumers to find the healthier option</li>
		<li>Action on Salt is today calling for compulsory front of pack nutritional labelling on all food products AND for bold and comprehensive salt reduction targets to be set in 2020</li>

	<p>
Following the shock findings from their new nationwide survey1, Action on Salt, the expert group based at Queen Mary University of London, is today calling for immediate compulsory front of pack nutritional labelling on ALL picnic savouries as the food content of a ‘typical’ picnic basket could contain more than 5g of salt!	
	</p>
	<p>
The new research, which analysed 555 savoury picnic finger foods available from retailers, highlights the worrying levels of salt in these products whereby one in four are HIGH in salt and would qualify for a red label on front of pack2.		
	</p>

	<p>
Whilst it is not surprising that olives are salty, the salt content of certain products is appalling. Aldi Specially Selected Hand Stuffed Halkidiki Olives 150g have 5g of salt per 100g, which is double the salt concentration of seawater3 and 1.9g of salt per portion – that’s a third of an adult’s daily-recommended limit of salt in just 5 olives4. Marks & Spencer Stone in Full Bodied Greek Kalamata Olives 260g had a shocking 4.23g of salt per suggested 130g portion!

	<p>Aside from olives, other salt offenders with the highest salt per portion include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ginsters Cornish Pasty (272g) with 2.99g of salt per portion, equivalent to 7 portions of salted peanuts5</li>
		<li>Aldi Eat & Go Sausages & Ketchup with 2.2g per portion, as much salt as 4.5 bags of ready salted crisps6</li>
		<li>Fry's Spicy 3 Bean Pasty (200g), 1.8g per portion which is the amount of salt in a McDonald’s hamburger and fries7</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In comparison, Scotch eggs, with an average salt content of 0.76g/100g and quiche, with an average salt content of 0.54g/100g, were the lowest salt categories.</p>

	<h2>Salt Targets(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<p>
Salt targets were set in 2014 to be met by 20178. In 2018, Public Health England (PHE) released an analysis of the food industry’s progress towards achieving the 2017 targets which revealed many of the targets had not been fully met. Our survey similarly found a staggering half of products were higher in salt than their average salt targets and 17% had more salt than their maximum target. These include:		
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Higgidy Bold & Earthy Spinach, Feta & Roasted Tomato Quiche 155g – 0.89g/100g (max salt target: 0.68g/100g)</li>
		<li>Waitrose & Partners Spanish Style Chicken Kebabs 80g – 0.95g/100g (max salt target: 0.88g/100g)</li>
		<li>Pork Farms Original Medium Pork Pie – 1.32g/100g (max salt target: 1g/100g)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Over the last two years, PHE and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) have taken little action to encourage the food industry to meet the 2017 targets. However following the release of the Health Minister’s Green Paper last month, now is the opportunity to engage food companies in salt reduction, reiterate the need to meet the 2017 targets and ensure that the proposed 2020 salt reduction targets9 are strictly monitored.

	<h2>Saturated Fat(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<p>
Despite new guidance from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition11 to reduce our saturated fat intake, nearly half of products surveyed were worryingly high in saturated fat. Morrisons Cheese & Onion Slices 330g contain 17.7g of saturated fat per portion – almost a woman’s recommended daily limit of saturated fat12.		
	</p>
	<p>
Next up is Asda Extra Special Maple Cured Smoked Bacon Quiche Lorraine with Butter Enriched Shortcrust Pastry 410g with 11g of saturated fat per 100g and a huge 14g per portion – almost as much saturated fat as in 5 McDonald’s hamburgers13. Lower saturated fat versions are available including Asda Smartprice Cheese & Bacon Quiche with 7g/100g and almost half the amount of saturated fat per portion (9g) and at half the price of the ‘luxury’ product, this is a better buy for health.

	<h2>Front of Pack Labelling(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<p>
Almost one in three products have no colour-coded front of pack (FoP) labelling – so how are consumers supposed to find healthier options if they are not correctly labelled? Furthermore, consumers may buy these products at the deli counter where NO nutrition labelling is available. Of those products without FoP labelling, more than 40% are high in salt – many of which are olive products which do not currently have a specific salt target set by PHE. It’s therefore imperative that the 2023 targets MUST be comprehensive with clear definitions of the products each target covers.

	<h2>Salty Picnic Basket(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<p>
Mhairi Brown, Nutritionist at Action on Salt explains: “This survey highlights just how easy it is for consumers to unknowingly eat huge amounts of salt and saturated fat hidden in savoury snacks and picnic favourites.  Food manufacturers must get on board in our efforts to improve the nation’s health. We found a large variation in the salt content of product categories proving reformulation is easily achievable. We want to see the food industry disclosing nutritional information clearly on front of pack on all products so everyone can easily find healthier options.”
