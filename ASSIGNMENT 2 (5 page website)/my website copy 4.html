	<h2>Falling in love with the meal.(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<p>
One skillet is all you need to make this tender and juicy apple cider chicken. The process is really easy: coat chicken thighs with a cozy, flavorful mix of warm spices and cook them in a skillet. Remove, and then prepare a super simple apple cider pan sauce with sweet apples and shallots. This is a quick, crowd-pleasing 35-minute dinner recipe youâ€™ll want to make on repeat all autumn long!

The best part of this dish, obviously besides its ease and the FABULOUS apple cider pan sauce, is the robust mix of spices. I adapted this dish from a <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/spiced-pork-tenderloin-with-sauted-apples ">Cooking Light</a> recipe I found, and added quite a bit more spice so the flavors really stand out.

	<h2>Use These Spices for the Best Flavor(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Salt & Pepper</li>
		<li>Ground Coriander</li>
		<li>Ground Cinnamon</li>
		<li>Ground Nutmeg</li>
		<li>Dried Thyme Leaves</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
You also need chicken, a little butter and olive oil, a touch of brown sugar, apples (no need to peel), shallots, andâ€¦ the star of the showâ€¦ <strong>apple cider</strong>. Be sure to use apple cider, the nonalcoholic beverage, and not apple cider vinegar. Youâ€™ll be deeply disappointed with that mistake!	
	</p>
	<p>
<strong>A little tip:</strong> Fresh apple cider typically appears in grocery stores and farm markets around late summer, but can get harder to find by the end of the year. To ensure I can make this cozy recipe all throughout the winter, I like to freeze some apple cider in an ice cube tray, then defrost a couple of frozen cider cubes whenever I want to make it. Or try making your own <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-apple-cider/">homemade apple cider</a>!

	<h2>Success Tip: Use Chicken Thighs Instead of Chicken Breasts(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<p>
If you want to make this recipe with chicken breasts instead of thighs you can, but youâ€™ll lose some flavor. Chicken thighs are a fattier cut of meat, so they taste much richer than chicken breast meat. They are also smaller than most chicken breasts, so they cook faster on the stove. If you use chicken breasts, I recommend buying the thin-sliced or tenderloin cuts.

But for best results with this recipe, I strongly recommend chicken thighs.

	<h2>Start the Chicken, Then Make the Pan Sauce(This was posted on <time datetime="2024-08-27 12:00">this Wednesday at mid-day</time>).</h2>
	<p>
Ideally, you want a pretty big skillet for this recipe, and I usually use my 12-inch cast-iron skillet. This is the same skillet I use to make creamy garlic chicken and walnut crusted chicken. If your skillet is small, you can cook the chicken in batches. You can also use a Dutch oven.		
	</p>
	<p>
Sprinkle the spice mixture on both sides of the chicken thighs, then cook the chicken in a little oil, flipping once, until both sides are golden-brown and the internal temperature has reached 165Â°F (74Â°C).
Remove the chicken and set aside.

Add the butter to the pan (donâ€™t wipe it out firstâ€”you want the flavorful spices and drippings from the chicken in there for the pan sauce!), and swirl to coat. Add the apple and shallot slices and sprinkle with the remaining salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften. Pour in the apple cider, and cook until the apples are crisp-tender, and the sauce has thickened a bit.
Finish up by adding the cooked chicken back to the panâ€”just for a couple minutes, to warm it back up and mix everything together.

I like to garnish the dish with more thyme, plus some fresh rosemary if I have it on hand. To serve, place the chicken thighs on plates, then top each piece of chicken with a big scoop of apples and shallots, along with that delicious apple cider pan sauce.
